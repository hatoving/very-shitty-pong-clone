# very shitty pong clone

This is a very badly made pong clone. 
This repo is just me trying to make a pong clone, and use that as an excuse to learn C++.

I'm quite new to C++, and Makefiles (and even choosing software to code in, I used Code::Blocks to code and build this for god's sakes), so I can't really provide build instructions.
I'm a lil dumb boy.

# The stuff that it uses lmfao

It uses SFML and that's it really.
